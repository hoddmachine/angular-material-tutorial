# Angular Material Tutorial

## Installation

Make sure you have npm, typings and typescript installed.

_Only Mac users can use brew to install node, windows users will have to go to node's website and download an executable installation package_
```sh
brew install node
npm install typings -g
npm install typescript -g
```

Now clone the repository.
```sh
git clone git@github.com:hoddmachine/angular-material-tutorial.git
cd angular-material-tutorial
```

Inside the root folder link the typescript compiler.
```sh
npm link typescript
```

Install all the dependices.
```sh
npm install
```

Now you can run the application.
```sh
npm start
```

The application will open up in a browser with live update turned on, so all changes made in the source code invoke a page refrehs.
